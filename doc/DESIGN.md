# Design Specification

For specifying design, this project uses Architecture decision records ([ADRs](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-start-using-adrs)).

Rather than specifying a large document that may eventually become obsolete, this system allows for an accumulation of decisions that are made for the project, which organically follows lean software development processes.
